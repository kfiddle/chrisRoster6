This is the backend of an app which manages logistics for a professional orchestra. Players, the orchestral library, various performances, rehearsals, and most importantly, seating rosters are all "orchestrated" here. For example: If you're in charge of an orchestra and your second flute player, who's also doubling on piccolo, can't make it to the performance on Friday, you'll need to find a substitute. Everything is here to help you keep track on a complex situation. Plus, a Log of Events is stored so that player's responses, etc.. are tallied and organized. Players can be asked by email regarding their availablity, and their replies will autopopulate their chairs on certain performances. Two front-ends in React are what I use for the UI's.

The following technologies are demonstrated in this app

Spring Data JPA

Spring Security
